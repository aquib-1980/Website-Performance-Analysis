🌐 Website Performance Analysis
📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes website performance metrics to identify patterns in user engagement, traffic sources, and session behavior. The goal is to uncover insights that help improve website efficiency and user experience using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

🎯 Objectives

Understand user engagement trends (sessions, bounce rates, engagement time).
Identify which channels drive the most engaged sessions.
Analyze peak performance hours and conversion-driving traffic sources.
Provide data-driven recommendations to enhance website performance.

🧰 Tools & Technologies

Programming Language: Python 
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
IDE: Jupyter Notebook
Data Source: data-export.csv

📈 Key Insights

Highest engagement was observed during evening hours (6 PM–10 PM).
Organic Search and Direct traffic generated the most engaged sessions.
Engagement rate correlates strongly with average session time.
Potential improvement areas include low-performing channels with high traffic but low engagement.

📊 Visualizations

Channel-wise engagement comparison
Time-based user engagement patterns
Top traffic source analysis

💡 Key Learnings

Improved data cleaning & preprocessing using Pandas.
Enhanced data storytelling through visualization.
Learned to identify and communicate insights clearly.
